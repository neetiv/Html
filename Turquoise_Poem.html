<h1>Turquoise</h1>
<h3> By: Aadya </h3>

<p>You’re turquoise<br>
A heart wrenching<br>Blue-green<br>That everyone loves<br>Whether it’s their favorite<br>Or whether it’s just okay<br>You steal other colors’ light<br>But you give more than<br>You will ever be able to take<br>You freeze<br>You move<br>You go anywhere you please<br>You fall<br>You get up<br>You will always catch up<br>You grab my heart<br>And rip it out of your body<br>Just for the fun of it<br>But my glowing turquoise<br>Dream<br>Will come to an end<br>And you will move<br>To a place where people<br>Don’t think in colors<br>They think in numbers<br>To a place where people<br>Don’t think about water<br>They think only about the future<br>They’ll forget about the present<br>They’ll forget the gift<br>Of you<br>That I let go<br>Not out of generosity<br>But because you wanted to<br>You wanted to leave the dark purple<br>And lose your turquoise<br>To go to the school of codes<br>To the place of no color<br>To a place without me<br>A place without<br>The brilliant combination<br>Of turquoise and purple<br><br></p>
